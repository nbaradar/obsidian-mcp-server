## Obsidian MCP Server

This project exposes one or more local Obsidian vaults to Claude Desktop through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The server is built with FastMCP, uses `vaults.yaml` to whitelist vault paths, and provides tools for listing, creating, reading, updating, deleting, and searching markdown notes. See `AGENTS.md` for the detailed design notes and roadmap.
